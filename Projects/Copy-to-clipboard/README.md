# Copy to Clipboard

A tiny web tool that lets you **copy text with one click**.

## What it does
- Type something in the first box.
- Click "Copy" and the text is copied to your clipboard.
- Works instantly in the browser.

## Why I made it
This was to practice JavaScript event listeners and working with the Clipboard API. It’s a practical, interactive little project that can be useful in real situations.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Type some text in the first input box.
3. Click the "Copy" button.
4. Paste it somewhere to check it worked.
