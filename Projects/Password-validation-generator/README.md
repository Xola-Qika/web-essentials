# Password Validation Generator

A small web form that checks if your password meets basic security requirements.

## What it does
- Lets the user type an email and password.
- Shows a list of rules for the password:
  - Lowercase letter
  - Uppercase letter
  - Number
  - Minimum 8 characters.

## Why I made it
I wanted to practice form validation and user input feedback with JavaScript. It’s a simple project but shows understanding of how to check user input dynamically.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Type your email and password.
3. Check if your password follows the rules.
