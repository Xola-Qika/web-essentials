# Nelson Mandela Tribute Page

A tribute web page highlighting the life, achievements, and story of Nelson Mandela.

## What it does
- Displays a header with Mandela’s quote and photo.
- Sections cover: biography, achievements, interesting facts, and sacrifices.
- Structured layout using divs and CSS styling.
- Clear typography and section separation for readability.

## Why I made it
I wanted to practice page layout and typography, while making a project that shows content organization skills and basic design principles.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Scroll through the page to read about Nelson Mandela.
3. All content is static and styled for clarity and visual hierarchy.
