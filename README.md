## My Web Development Journey 

Hi there! I’m Xola, and this is where I share my web development work and experiments.

I started learning web development because I wanted to create things that work and feel good to use. For me, the best way to learn is by building, testing, breaking, and then figuring out how to fix it. Each line of code teaches me something new—sometimes a small trick, other times a bigger lesson about logic, design, or user experience.

## About Me

I enjoy learning by doing. Rather than following tutorials blindly, I like to dive in, try ideas, and see how they turn out in the browser. Sometimes things don’t work the first time—and that’s okay. Debugging and problem-solving are part of the fun.

I focus on building clean, responsive, and interactive web experiences, paying attention to the little details that make a website feel polished. Beyond just writing code, I’m learning to think like a developer: planning features, considering usability, and finding the most efficient solutions.

## Skills & Focus Areas

HTML & CSS – Structuring content and styling it for both desktop and mobile.

JavaScript – Adding interactivity, handling events, and building logical features.

Responsive Design – Making sure everything looks good on any device.

Problem-Solving – Debugging, testing, and improving code iteratively.

Creativity & Attention to Detail – Small changes can make a big difference in how a site feels.

## How I Work

I like to experiment, break things, and figure out solutions on my own first. I’m always learning—whether it’s a new JavaScript technique, a layout trick, or a better way to structure my code. I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to improve.

## Why This Repo Exists

This repository is my space to practice, learn, and grow. It’s not just about showing work—it’s about tracking progress and experimenting with new ideas. I update it as I improve, so anyone following along can see how my skills evolve over time.

Thanks for visiting! I hope this gives you a sense of how I approach web development and why I enjoy building things.
