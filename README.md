## My Web Development Journey 🌐

Hi there! I’m Xola, and this is where I share my web development work and experiments.

I started learning web development because I wanted to create things that work and feel good to use. For me, the best way to learn is by building, testing, breaking, and then figuring out how to fix it. Each line of code teaches me something new—sometimes a small trick, other times a bigger lesson about logic, design, or user experience.

## About Me

I enjoy learning by doing. Rather than following tutorials blindly, I like to dive in, try ideas, and see how they turn out in the browser. Sometimes things don’t work the first time—and that’s okay. Debugging and problem-solving are part of the fun.

I focus on building clean, responsive, and interactive web experiences, paying attention to the little details that make a website feel polished. Beyond just writing code, I’m learning to think like a developer: planning features, considering usability, and finding the most efficient solutions.
