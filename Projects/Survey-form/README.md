# Survey Form

A simple web form to collect user opinions about movies.

## What it does
- Collects basic user info: Name, Email, Age, Gender.
- Lets users choose their favorite movie types and actors.
- Asks questions about movie habits and preferences.
- Uses radio buttons and checkboxes for easy selection.
- Basic form validation is handled by HTML’s `required` attribute.

## Why I made it
I wanted to practice forms, input types, and UI layou with CSS and HTML. It’s a small but practical project showing I can design interactive forms.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Fill in the form fields and select your preferences.
3. Press Submit (form action is empty, so it won’t send data anywhere).
