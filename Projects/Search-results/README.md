# Search Results Page

A web page mimicking a search engine results layout.

## What it does
- Users can type a query in the search bar.
- Shows example search results with clickable links.
- Includes “People also search for” suggestions.
- Styled with a simple grid layout for links and images.

## Why I made it
This was to practice HTML layout, CSS positionin, and basic UI design. It’s a small project but it shows I can replicate real-world page designs with my won designs.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Type in the search box (though it’s static—just for demo).
3. Click the links to open them in new tabs.
