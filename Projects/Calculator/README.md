# Calculator

A simple web calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## What it does
- Can do basic math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Works fully in the browser—no backend needed.

## Why I made it
I wanted to practice JavaScript  and how to manipulate the DOM. It’s a small project but shows how buttons can interact with the screen and perform calculations.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click the buttons to type numbers and operators.
3. Press `=` to see the result, `C` to clear.
