# Slug Generator

A simple web tool that converts a post or page title into a URL-friendly slug.

## What it does
- Takes any text input and turns it into a lowercase, hyphen-separated slug.
- Removes spaces, special characters, and capital letters for clean URLs.
- Copy the generated slug to your clipboard with one click.

## Why I made it
I wanted to practice JavaScript string manipulation while building a small, useful tool that can be used for blog posts or web pages. This project also helped me practice DOM handling and interactive UI elements.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Type or paste a title into the input box.
3. Click "Generate" to create the slug.
4. Click "Copy" to save it to your clipboard.
